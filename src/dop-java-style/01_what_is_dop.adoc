=== Monolithic history

Back 10 years+.
Back in that time Application usually solved the problem for an organisation with one solution.

May they be whole companies or "only" one department, big monolithic applications were the result.

It's nothing wrong with one UI and shared model to with modules doing *there* thing.

It simply does not *scale* that dependently and are not that *easily updated* one by one.

=== Self-Contained Systems

I hope that was the reason why your applications were migrated to microservivces.

Microservices or Self-contained Systems are more oriented on doing one thing i.e. Process or process steps correctly and are there for tighter coupled to the data needed for there work.

No need to share anemic model and handle all the edge-cases every time.

One step further is even possible.

=== Even smaller

Application in the cloud are even more tide to data.

With Azure Functions or AWS Lamdas the data is main focus and less the overall process/organization.

Functions do a thing with data, but the data only has a shape no logic.
Logic is implemented dependently from the data.

=== Data Orientation means

* Data is Data and nothing but the data
* Strict separation between data and logic
* like functional programming

Data Oriented Programming as the name suggests focuses on data and the separation between data and logic
guides:

* Interfaces are there to model choices in type, no need for methods
* Records work as carrier of data and ofter are used nested, only few methods are needed
* static Methods without state do the "heavy" lifting

This enables the possibility to modle Domain as immutable, error state free, nothing but the data.

Features (in terms of new logic) does not infer domain objects it grows besides
