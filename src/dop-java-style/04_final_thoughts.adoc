=== Make your Opinion
For every te am there are different trade-offs:

* Readability - learn and use
* Duplication - not always bad
* Testability - no brain needed
* Performance - don't guess, measure!

// === Readability
// patterns are great
// switch is great
// big patterns get clumsy and messy

// === Duplication
// at the start feels like that
// get may contribute to readability
// contributes the no inference, if readability is needed -> new method based on inference

// === Performance
// "measure dont guess" - any performance expert

// === Testability
// huge plus
// easy to do with basics
// 100% is possible because of few to no edge cases
