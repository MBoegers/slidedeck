We need to refactor small parts again and again to move twoards our goal.
Lets see what Refactorings are and how we can make use of them

=== Refactorings

[quote,Fowler]
Refactoring is a controlled technique for *improving* the design of an *existing code* base.
Its essence is applying a series of small behavior-preserving transformations, *each* of which "*too small* to be worth doing".

This is the traffic flow of netflix, but it illustrates how ofthe this process have to be repeated.

We have to spent money on automation to save only on the long run!
Its like CI/CD but with modernization, and for the we need a tool like open Rewrite.
